# Voice Stack TTS Production Configuration Template
# Copy this file to the repository root as .env and customize as needed

# ---- Server ----
ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
HOST=0.0.0.0
TTS_PORT=5002
CORS_ORIGINS=*

# ---- Debugpy (disable in production) ----
DEBUGPY_ENABLE=false

# ---- TTS ----
# Engine: Currently only coqui is supported
TTS_ENGINE=coqui

# Device: cuda (for NVIDIA GPU), cpu (for CPU-only), or auto (auto-detect)
# Change to cuda if you have NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
# Note: TTS benefits significantly from GPU acceleration
TTS_DEVICE=cpu

# Model: Coqui XTTS-v2 (multi-lingual neural TTS)
# Default model from Hugging Face: tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2
# Models are cached to ~/.local/share/tts/ by default
TTS_MODEL=tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v2

# Voices Directory: Path to directory containing voice sample .wav files
# Voice samples are used for voice cloning
# Each .wav file becomes a selectable voice (filename without extension)
TTS_VOICES_DIR=voices

# Audio Settings
TTS_SAMPLE_RATE=24000

# Text Chunking: XTTS processes text in chunks
# MAX_CHARS: Maximum characters per chunk (adjust based on memory)
# MIN_CHARS: Minimum characters per chunk
TTS_MAX_CHARS=180
TTS_MIN_CHARS=70

# Retry: Number of retry attempts for failed TTS requests
TTS_RETRY_STEPS=2

# Language Settings
# DEFAULT_LANG: Default language if not specified in request
# AUTO_LANG: Auto-detect language from input text
# LANG_HINT: Provide a hint for language detection (e.g., "en,es,fr")
# FORCE_LANG: Force a specific language (overrides auto-detection)
TTS_DEFAULT_LANG=en
TTS_AUTO_LANG=true
TTS_LANG_HINT=
TTS_FORCE_LANG=

# ---- Notes ----
# 1. For GPU support, ensure CUDA 12.1+ and appropriate drivers are installed
# 2. Run scripts/install_torch.sh to install PyTorch with CUDA support
# 3. Add voice samples (.wav files) to the voices/ directory for voice cloning
# 4. Voice samples should be:
#    - Clear, high-quality audio
#    - 6-12 seconds long
#    - Single speaker
#    - 22050Hz or 24000Hz sample rate (will be resampled if needed)
# 5. TTS is memory-intensive; GPU with 8GB+ VRAM recommended for production
# 6. Supported languages: en, es, fr, de, it, pt, pl, tr, ru, nl, cs, ar, zh-cn, ja, hu, ko
# 7. First request will download the model (may take time)
